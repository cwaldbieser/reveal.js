                            Note:

                            + Reference groups are like atoms, but some queries are like sub-atomic
                              particles.  Their results belong in *basis* groups that can be used
                              to build up a proper reference group.
                                - Employee classification reference groups are either pulled directly 
                                  from Banner or built up from basis groups.
                                    - active_positions, temp_emp: These concepts from the Banner payroll 
                                      system are *similar* to the employee definitions, but still needs some
                                      fine tuning to represent an accurate source of truth.
                                - Sometimes need to be combined with manually attested groups for edge 
                                  cases.  E.g. *nonexempt_pt_wo_positions*
                                - Larger reference groups can be built up from smaller ones.  E.g.
                                  *students* are composed of each class year, part timers, students on
                                  leave of absence, etc.

                            ## Bundles

                            Bundles group *unrelated* cohorts that have access to the same set of services.

                            Note:

                            + Bundles are a *cohort*, not an access policy.
                            + If the cohorts were related, they could just be composed in a larger reference group.
                            + Changes to policies may require splitting up bundles.
                            + Alternatively, it may make sense to expand a bundle if policies become more broadly applied.
                            + If you have a lot of churn in bundle composition, you need to ask yourself if you are really saving yourself any effort in terms of management.
                            + Example: Trustee Services bundle.  Includes:
                                - Active trustees

                            + Policies are where exceptions should be allowed.
                            + Policies don't represent truth about a cohort; they
                              describe who is allowed to access a resource.

                            Note:

                            * Important- never assign permissions directly to a *subject*.
                            * Setting up an *app* in Grouper takes time.  You want to make sure permissions
                              on the access policies are set correctly.  This is an easilly overlooked step
                              if the wheel user is the only one doing the configuration.
                            * At LC, we create app admin and viewer groups in the local "etc" folder for
                              every app.  One place to manage the permissions for the app makes it maangeable.
                            * The account use to create a group automatically is assigned as an admin.  This
                              account should be removed from the permissions on each group.

                            Note:

                            When students are onboarded, they are added to the early-onboarded
                            cohort.  We don't want to have to remember to remove them from the
                            cohort later, after the term starts.

                            Drilling into each membership and setting the expiration time is
                            tedious.  A Jython script handles this much more simply and consistently.
