                            ## Bundles

                            Simply put, bundles are a way to group similar cohorts that tend to have
                            the same access to the same set of services.  They are a management tool
                            to make managing permissions simpler.

                            Note:

                            + Bundles are a *cohort*, not an access policy.
                            + If the cohorts were related, they could just be composed in a larger reference group.
                            + Changes to policies may require splitting up bundles.
                            + Alternatively, it may make sense to expand a bundle if policies become more broadly applied.
                            + If you have a lot of churn in bundle composition, you need to ask yourself if you are really saving yourself any effort in terms of management.
                            + Example: Trustee Services bundle.  Includes:
                                - Active trustees
                                - Alumni associates
                                - Board associates
                                - Cabinet members
                                - Student associates

                            ## Access and Provisioning Policies

                            Note:
                            + Every service at LC whose access control is managed by Grouper has
                              a folder under the "app" stem.
                            + Each folder has a similar structure with its own "etc" folder for
                              managing the policy admins and viewers.
                            + Policies come in triples: An allow policy, a deny policy, and the
                              final policy which is allow minus deny. 
                            + *Only* policies are exported from Grouper to target systems.
                            + At LC, we place the policies available for export in an "export" sub-folder.
                              This makes them easy to locate, it makes it clear which policies are going 
                              to be exported, and it makes configuration easier on the export side.

                            ## Permissions and Delegation in Grouper

                            Note:

                            * Setting up an *app* in Grouper takes time.  You want to make sure permissions
                              on the access policies are set correctly.  This is an easilly overlooked step
                              if the wheel user is the only one doing the configuration.
                            * At LC, we create app admin and viewer groups in the local "etc" folder for
                              every app.  One place to manage the permissions for the app makes it maangeable.
                            * The account use to create a group automatically is assigned as an admin.  This
                              account should be removed from the permissions on each group.
